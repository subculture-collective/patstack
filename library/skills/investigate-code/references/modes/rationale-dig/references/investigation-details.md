# Investigation details

## Code anchor

Before spawning investigators, collect relevant file paths and line ranges, key symbols, recent commits touching the target, PR numbers from merge subjects, and linked ticket IDs. Use:

```bash
git blame -L <start>,<end> <file>
git log --follow -p -- <file>
git log --oneline -20 -- <file>
git log -1 --format=%B <commit>
gh pr view <number> --json title,body,author,createdAt,mergedAt,labels,closingIssuesReferences,comments,reviews
# Organization repositories: PRs merged before 2026-11-10 are on Gitea, later ones on GitHub.
# Gitea (git.subcult.tv): tea pulls <number> --login subcult-agent, or
# tea api --login subcult-agent /repos/<owner>/<repo>/pulls/<number> (and .../issues/<number>/comments)
```

Pass this seed context to every investigator so they do not rediscover it.

## Coverage roster

Discover MCPs from the client's available-tools list (Claude Code `/mcp`, Codex `codex mcp list`, the `mcp` section of OpenCode config). Map each to one primary category; record ambiguous mappings in the coverage map. Launch all matching investigators in one message, one agent per category:

1. **Source control** (git, `gh`, comments, tests): implementation-time rationale in PR descriptions, review discussions, tests, commits, and comments. Always spawn.
2. **Issue/ticket tracker** (Linear, Jira, GitHub Issues, Plane, Shortcut): product/business forcing functions, customer or compliance needs, scope changes, and initiatives.
3. **Long-form documents** (Notion, Confluence, Google Docs, Coda): PRDs, RFCs, ADRs, specs, notes, and postmortems.
4. **Real-time team chat** (Slack, Discord, Teams, Mattermost): deliberation, incident decisions, and rationale not recorded elsewhere.
5. **Infrastructure observability** (Datadog, New Relic, Honeycomb, Grafana, Splunk): monitors, metrics, logs, traces, incidents, and runtime signals behind constants or defenses.
6. **Error/exception tracking** (Sentry, Rollbar, Bugsnag, Airbrake): error trajectories, stack traces, release correlations, and defensive-code motivation.
7. **Product analytics warehouse** (Databricks, Snowflake, BigQuery, ClickHouse, dbt, Redshift): usage, flags, experiments, distributions behind thresholds, migrations, and data scale.

Use the client's general-purpose subagent with its default model unless the user names one. Investigators need MCP and tool access; that access is not permission to write. Add `sources/incident-postmortem.md` when the target is defensive (null checks, retries, timeouts, rate limits, feature flags, egress guards, OOM handling).

## Skips and synthesis

Skip only if no matching MCP is available (name it as a gap) or the source is provably irrelevant. “Probably irrelevant” is not enough. The rare inline answer is permitted only after confirming that all seven available category searches would be redundant.

Spawn one general-purpose synthesizer subagent (client default model unless the user names one) with the same read-only instruction. Provide investigator findings including nulls/skips, code anchor, original question, `epistemics.md`, and `synthesizer-prompt.md`. It returns the final confidence-weighted, evidence-cited narrative; do not rewrite its confidence language.

## Output conventions

Use the sections listed in SKILL.md. Direct evidence has precise citations (commit hash, PR, ticket, URL, chat permalink, or file:line). Inferences state their evidence chain and use hedged language. Contradictions remain visible. Sources Consulted has one line per investigator:

```text
- <Source>: <what was searched>. <what was found, or "no relevant results," or "skipped. reason">.
```

For example: `- Real-time team chat (Slack): skipped. No matching MCP available in this environment. Gap: conversational record not searched.`

Avoid confident storytelling, treating code as proof of its own intent, recency bias, agreeing with the user's hypothesis without checking, omitting gaps, anticipatory skips, and collapsing investigators into one agent.
